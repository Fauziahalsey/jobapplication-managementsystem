This README is for my GitHub repository I hope this template saves you time and effort as well as provides you with some consistency across my project.
this project is about a job search portal whereby you can access the job you want by searching for it or it can be displayed and you will just apply for it

#### Technologies


- Javascript
- Html

  ## HOW TO USE
I styled using CSS to make it visually appealing and added some size to the fonts and paragraphs.
In Html, I just called the variables and added a voting button functionality that is done with js where
it enables the button to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
